        <h1>Privacy Policy for Stock Ticker Challenge</h1>
        <p>Last Updated: 3 Jan 2024</p>

        <p>Welcome to "Stock Ticker Challenge"! We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. This privacy policy outlines how we handle and safeguard the information you may interact with when using our application.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <p>Stock Ticker Challenge is designed to not collect, store, or process any personal information of its users. Our service does not require user registration, and we do not track or store any personal identifiers.</p>

        <h2>2. Data Storage and Usage</h2>
        <p>In Stock Ticker Challenge, we require users to input a stock ticker symbol to fetch related stock data from an external API. Here is how we handle this data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>User Input:</strong> Users enter stock ticker symbols which are used to make requests to an external API for fetching stock data. This is the primary interaction involving user input.</li>
            <li><strong>Caching of Data:</strong> To enhance performance and reduce the number of API calls, our application temporarily caches the entered stock ticker symbols on our server. This cached data is stored for a period of two days and is then automatically deleted. The caching is solely for operational efficiency and is not used for any other purpose.</li>
            <li><strong>API Interaction:</strong> The stock ticker symbols entered by users are utilized to retrieve stock data from an external API. This process is limited to obtaining the requested stock information and does not involve any further processing or storage of personal information.</li>
            <li><strong>No Persistent Storage of Personal Information:</strong> Apart from the temporary caching mentioned above, we do not engage in any persistent storage of user data or personal information. All user interactions are confined to the specific session within the app, with no long-term storage or tracking.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Our application does not rely on third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>

        <h2>4. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies to track the activity within our application.</p>

        <h2>5. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "last updated" date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at <a href="mailto:hall88422@yahoo.com">hall88422@yahoo.com</a>.</p>
